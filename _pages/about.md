<div style="text-align: justify;">


<p>I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.eeis.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/">Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Systems</a> at the <a href="https://www.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/soe">Graduate School of Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ja/index.html">The University of Tokyo</a>. My research focuses on developing innovative neuron models that strike a balance between biological fidelity and computational efficiency. Specifically, I am working on creating a mixed-signal neuromorphic chip that leverages these advanced models to enhance computational capabilities in various applications.</p>

<p>My academic journey has been marked by a deep interest in the intersection of electronics and neuroscience. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a solid foundation in electrical engineering principles, which I am now applying to cutting-edge research in neuromorphic engineering. My current work involves exploring novel algorithms and optimization techniques, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Bayesian Optimization, to fine-tune neuron models and improve their performance.</p>
